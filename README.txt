# Age Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing age distribution data across different countries using Python and Pandas, with visualizations created using Matplotlib. The analysis focuses on three age groups: 0-14 years, 15-64 years, and 65+ years.

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-data-analysis.git
cd age-data-analysis
Place your CSV data file (age_data.csv) in the project directory.

Run the analysis script:

python
Copy
Edit
python age_analysis.py
The script will generate visualizations for the average age group distribution and a histogram for the age group 0-14.
Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from [insert source or description of your dataset here]. The dataset includes information about the population distribution in different age groups for various countries.

Results
The analysis produces:

A bar chart showing the average percentage of different age groups.
A histogram illustrating the distribution of the age group 0-14 years.
